                               Version 1.3-0 (CRAN)
================================================================================
### New Features

-   Removed dependency on 'dplyr' and migrated all code to 'data.table' to ensure efficiency and speed for large data sets.
-   Added functionality to apply point-to-pixel validation. The metrics analyzed are: Pearson correlation coefficient (CC), root mean square error (RMSE), modified Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), relative bias (PBIAS), probability of detection (POD), false alarm rate (FAR), critical success index (CSI).
-   Removed dependencies on external libraries for FAR, POD, CSI calculations. Calculations are now performed using R base functions.
-   A complete refactoring of the code has been carried out to improve its efficiency and ease of maintenance.

### Bug Fixe
-   Fixed a bug in 'wet.day' when set to False, rounding was still performed.
-   Fixed 'pboptions' slash bug that caused a new slash to be created at each iteration when setting char = “=”.
================================================================================
                           Version 1.2-2 (release-CRAN)
================================================================================
### New Features

-   We modified the description of the package to meet the corrections suggested by CRAN.
-   Replaced by \dontrun with \donttest. due to the time of execution of the example. (\> 5 seconds)

================================================================================
                           Version 1.2-1 (release-CRAN)
================================================================================
### New Features

-   The word quantile mapping was changed to Quantile Mapping due to CRAN's comment of “ Words possibly misspelled in DESCRIPTION”.
-   A test optimization was performed to address the problem of “the error Executing ‘testthat.R’ [421s/114s] the execution of the R code in ‘testthat.R’ had a CPU time 3.7 times higher than the elapsed time” reported by CRAN.

================================================================================
### New Features

-   The versioning used has been modified. The semantic versioning has been migrated to the versioning used by CRAN.
-   Changed the format for compatibility with the S3 method.
-   The input data verification methods were refactored.
-   Updated the data for the examples and internal tests

================================================================================
                         Version 1.1.3 (Local)
================================================================================
### New Features
-   Added support for adjusting the simulated distribution by quantile mapping and nonparametric quantile mapping.
-   We have changed the ranger library to Random Forest to make it compatible with terra predict.
-   Improvements have been made to the code to improve interpretation.

### Bug Fixed
-   Fixed an ID mess error when transforming the .csv with coordinates to a vector.
